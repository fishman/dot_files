;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual
;; mode.  Vimpulse is a set of modifications to viper, the minor mode
;; that emulates Vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon as it is
;; loaded, viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.
;; 
;; Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well already
;; though.  Patches and feature requests welcome.

;;; Installation:

;; 1. Copy vimpulse.el to somewhere in your load-path, e.g. your
;;    site-lisp directory.
;; 
;; 2. Add the following block of code to your ~/.emacs file.  (If the
;;    file does not exist, create it.  If you use Windows, see
;;    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html#TOC33 to
;;    learn where to save the file.  If you use a Mac, email the
;;    maintainer for help.)  Leave out the semicolons at the beginning
;;    of each line.
;; 
;(setq viper-mode t)                ; enable Viper at load time
;(setq viper-ex-style-editing nil)  ; can backspace past start of insert / line
;(require 'viper)                   ; load Viper
;(require 'vimpulse)                ; load Vimpulse
;(setq woman-use-own-frame nil)     ; don't create new frame for manpages
;(setq woman-use-topic-at-point t)  ; don't prompt upon K key (manpage display)
;; 
;; 3. (Optional) If you will be using C-r (the redo key) and you use
;;    GNU Emacs, also install http://wonderworks.com/download/redo.el
;;    and add (require 'redo) to your .emacs file.  (XEmacs and
;;    Aquamacs come with redo.el included.)
;; 
;; 4. (Optional) If you want a nice-looking block visual mode (i.e.
;;    rectangle selection), download and install
;;    http://emacswiki.org/elisp/download/rect-mark.el 
;;    in your load-path and add the Lisp expression (require
;;    'rect-mark) to your .emacs file. Block mode will work
;;    without rect-mark but you won't see the nice rectangle.
;; 
;; We would love it if you sent an email to the maintainer saying
;; whether you liked or disliked vimpulse and why, and which
;; additional Vim features you would like implemented soonest.

;;; Usage:

;; The only feature of vimpulse with documentation available is visual
;; mode.
;; 
;; Visual mode:
;; 
;; To use visual mode, press v in normal mode.  Then use the motion
;; commands to select the region.  Then press d to delete, c to
;; change, r to replace, or y to copy.  You can use p to paste.  For
;; linewise visual mode, press V instead of v.  Then you can copy and
;; paste whole lines. If you want go to block visual mode, press C-v.
;; Here you can copy and paste the selected rectangle, but you have
;; to use C-p. C-p is used because it was a simple way to add visual block
;; mode in a way *close* to Vim without having to hack viper mode to
;; use the normal 'p' key.  In the future, it would be nice to see
;; vimpulse provide this the "right" way, but at this point I'm too
;; inexperienced with elisp to make that happen.
;; In block and linewise visual mode you may use I or A the insert or append
;; text before or after the selection in each selected line.
;;
;;
;; Other features:
;; 
;; This documentation is not written yet.  For now, see the definition
;; of viper-vi-global-user-map right near the beginning of the code.
;; You'll see a list of keys and what function each one calls.  The
;; documentation that comes with Vim -- which is also online at
;; http://vimdoc.sf.net -- may also be helpful.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; - Vimpulse makes C-r run "redo" in command mode but you can 
;;   still get reverse i-search by pressing C-s then C-r.

;;; Bugs:

;; (We would appreciate very much if you report bugs.)
;; 
;; Known bugs:
;; 
;; - (class of bugs) In visual or line visual mode, pressing things
;;   like C-g or C-SPC tends to confuse Vimpulse and do weird things.
;; 
;; - When a '(' and a ')' are on different lines, the cursor won't
;;   go left over the ')'.  This also affects unmatched ')'s like :-).
;;     - The problem lies with the show-paren-function advice near
;;       middle of file.
;;         - Hmm, the function "modifies paren matching under viper to
;;           work like in (almost) like in vim".  What does that mean?
;;           Is it for C-x C-e or something?  I don't think so; I bet
;;           it's something to do with blinking parens or something.  I
;;           should ask Alessandro.
;;     - Workaround: press 2h to skip backwards past the paren, or X
;;       to delete it.
;; 
;; - In visual mode, repeatedly pressing H, M, or L acts weirdly.  (I
;;   wonder if there are other keys that act weirdly in that mode too.)
;; 
;; - cW positions the cursor wrongly when used on the last word of a line
;; 
;; - One user who uses an ancient emacs-snapshot (from 2005) mentions
;;   that this mode causes all the keys on his keyboard to stop
;;   working unless he deletes the line that reads 'viper--key-maps
;;   from the macro my-get-emulation-keymap in this file.
;; 
;; - cw with a count doesn't work the same as Vim when the point
;;   is just before a space between words
;;     - Fix plan: try cw with a count, then try dwi with a count; or,
;;       ask on a relevant forum how the commands differ; or, check
;;       how it works in Vi / Vim then check the Vim manual for more
;;       info; then, decide how to best fix.
;; 
;; - Undo has problems in XEmacs.

;;; Development and documentation TODOs:

;; - make sure I have added all stuff in Brad's viper additions and
;;   from my collection, then start documenting already.  Once there
;;   are even the simplest of docs (a nice key map) people will have a
;;   far easier time using vimpulse and so I bet more will contribute.
;; 
;; - the / key should allow isearch that works like Vim's, or until
;;   that's implemented, it should at least remap / to isearch-forward
;;   or viper-isearch-forward.  This should be an option that should
;;   be disabled by default.  For now, have viper load .vimrc and
;;   check for vim-specific option strings like "set incsearch".  If
;;   anyone complains, rethink that plan.
;; 
;; - Folding.  This should be implemented as a separate lisp library
;;   usable for even non-viper users.  Which foldmethods to do first?
;;   I personally only use foldmethod=marker, and even that only rarely.
;; 
;; - i_C-(I forgot the letter) should do (copy-from-above-command 1)
;;   from misc.el
;; 
;; - add advanced C-w commands; they can can use windmove.el
;;   (directional window-selection routines)
;; 
;; - add :set spell / :set nospell that uses flyspell-mode
;; 
;; - add support for tabs.el, a tabs mode that works sensibly (get it
;;   from Emacs Lisp List)
;;     - minimum needed: :tabedit, :tabnext, :tabprevious 
;;     - since I'm emulating Vim, emulate its tab pages feature.  So a
;;       tab page should be able to hold one or more buffers.
;; 
;; - add Customize option to let users stop C-r from being redo?
;; 
;; - email and try to get redo.el included with GNU Emacs (since I
;;   won't include redo.el here since nobody else includes it in their
;;   Lisp files either)
;; 
;; - copy more features from Brad's work in darcs and from vimpact
;;   into vimpulse
;; 
;; - doc: look in google chat log, find description of one-char-off
;;   bug, see if it applies to this or to the not-yet-released
;;   viper-x, and if to this, mention under Bugs
;; 
;; - doc: fix ref to "your home directory": Windows users don't have
;;   one
;; 
;; - doc: list all new keys (and maybe all differences from viper) in
;;   Usage section
;; 
;; - doc: describe all new keys in Usage section; can look at Vim
;;   manual for ideas
;; 
;; - modify how tramp works so it also automatically handles URLs
;;   typed in the netrw syntax, i.e. http:// etc.  But first ask tramp
;;   upstream if they could please make those changes themselves.
;; 
;; - try to clean up namespace to use only vimpulse- prefix (but do I
;;   need to worry about the viper-visual- stuff, or is that a
;;   separate-enough prefix?)
;; 
;; - add CTRL-O for jumping back in the jumplist and CTRL-I for
;;   jumping forwards (for undoing one CTRL-O).  I wonder if emacs'
;;   tags functionality allows a jumplist.  I wonder if viper does
;;   tags like nvi does.
;;     - The global mark ring is not what I want.
;;     - Try code.google.com/p/ejumplist/source/browse/trunk/jumplist.el
;; 
;; - on my PC (I run Ubuntu), if you start plain Vim then press CTRL-O
;;   many times, it starts opening recently opened files.  Is that
;;   useful?  Should vimpulse have persistent jump table functionality
;;   like that, and if so, should it use recentf or vim's .viminfo
;;   file or some tag functionality in emacs?  How will it interact
;;   with the fact that in emacs it's not traditional to suddenly
;;   close files without warning?
;; 
;; - make sentence movement work like in Vim.  I wonder if this can be
;;   done by setting viper options.
;;     - In Vim, according to :help sentence, end of sentence is:
;;         - '.', '?', or '!'
;;         - then (optionally) one or more '"', ''', ')', and ']'
;;           characters
;;         - then a newline, space, or tab.
;;         - A paragraph or section boundary is also a sentence
;;           boundary, but I bet viper handles that, and if it doesn't,
;;           it should.
;;             - A paragraph begins after each truly empty line (no
;;               whitespace chars on it) or after certain col-1 nroff
;;               macros.  A sentence begins after a form feed (^L), or
;;               certain nroff macros, in column 1.
;;             - The characters '{' and '}' sometimes affect paragraph
;;               definitions.  See :help paragraph.
;;     - In Viper, on the other hand, I bet sentences are like in vi,
;;       where Tabs aren't whitespace, and you need at least two spaces
;;       after the punctuation mark.
;; 
;; - try to get vimpulse included with upstream viper; also, ideally,
;;   if you pressed "v" in viper, viper would offer to load vimpulse.
;;   (likely to happen?  Consider that Michael Kifer, the viper
;;   maintainer, told me he doesn't need vim keys.  Then again, maybe
;;   I could convince him that it's worth it to ship vim keys, for
;;   other people's benefit.)
;; 
;; - email ridip <rdp@inthefaith.net> and ask him for his vimpulse
;;   contribs and his dvorak stuff
;; 
;; - email to Tromey for upload into ELPA?  we'd have to redo this
;;   when a new major version comes out.  Or maybe we should just
;;   contribute some auto-ELPA-management code.  By the way, should we
;;   move vimpulse into CVS somewhere?
;; 
;; - maybe merge all feature requests that anyone has ever sent into a
;;   "Feature requests" section here

;;; Development plans:

;; The design plan for Vimpulse is for it to only emulate features
;; that are in Vim.  Unfortunately, other new features do not belong
;; in Vimpulse unless you can get the Vim people to implement those
;; features too.

;;; Undecided development questions:

;; - In vimpulse, like in real vim, C-r only does redo in command
;;   mode; in insert mode it does something else.  (In vimpulse that
;;   "something else" is reverse i-search.)  Should it do reverse
;;   i-search in insert mode too?
;; 
;; - When you press "v" for visual mode, Vimpulse modifies the mode
;;   section of the modeline, so it reads e.g. "(Emacs-Lisp visual)".
;;   Shouldn't it do something to the <V> indicator instead?
;; 
;; - In Vim, when a line starts with a "// " or ";; " comment and I
;;   press enter, Vim extends the comment onto the next line.  What
;;   Vim function is it that does this?  Is the function enabled in
;;   plain vanilla Vim 7 as shipped by vim.org?  (Check by seeing how
;;   it works on Vim for Windows running on either Windows or Wine.)
;;   Is it mostly useful or mostly annoying?  Is it worth implementing
;;   in Emacs considering there are other easy ways to create
;;   comments?
;; 
;; - In v / V mode, Vim makes sure there is always at least 1 char /
;;   line selected.  IMO it provides nice feedback as to whether
;;   visual mode is on or not.  Is this worth implementing?  This is
;;   especially important for the block mode because currently it's
;;   impossible to select the last character in a line.
;; 
;; - Sometimes when you use C (viper-change-to-eol) or other change
;;   commands, Jason's new viper-exec-change function shows a message
;;   like "Deleted 50 characters" as a side effect.  Is that annoying?
;;     - Update 1 month later:  I hardly notice the message.
;;     - Dear users:  Do you think I should disable the message?
;; 
;; - I want to allow buffer-switching without using the C-x key, since
;;   C-x b RET an extremely large amount of times per day is
;;   uncomfortable for my right pinky which presses RET.  There's
;;   already :b which seems to just invoke switch-to-buffer.  Is this
;;   right?  Is it bad if I make vimpulse emulate set autowrite=on
;;   then write new multi-buffer code?  What should the code's user
;;   interface be like?  I really should switch back to Vim for a day,
;;   learn more about how it deals with multiple buffers at once (and
;;   maybe also with tab pages) and emulate whatever of Vim's is most
;;   convenient.  What do you think of all the above?\
;;     - update: IIRC :set hidden lets you switch buffers w/o saving
;;     - update from Sebastien Rocca Serra: :set wildmenu plus 
;;       tab-completion makes :b very pleasant to use when you have 
;;       50+ buffers open.  Wildmenu is almost like iswitchb or ido.
;;     - I wonder how well that stuff works with just a few buffers open.
;; 
;; - simulate Vim's set virtualedit=onemore option to make C-x C-e
;;   possible w/o first advancing to next line?
;; 
;; - Would it be bad to edit users' .viminfo files without asking
;;   permission, or should some variable have to be customized on to do
;;   such a thing?
;; 
;; - should gj and gk do longlines-style movement like in Vim?  I
;;   really must resolve my Windows vs. Unix line-length hangups by
;;   Googling or asking before I even think about this.
;; 
;; - is there any need to implement Vim's new
;;   [count]dk-can-go-past-top-of-file-without-error functionality (to
;;   me, no need) or any related functionality?
;; 
;; - What to do about xemacs?  It doesn't ship with woman.  I wonder
;;   if woman is in some xemacs package?

;;; Change Log:

;; Version 0.2.6.3:
;;  [frank.fischer@s2001.tu-chemnitz.de:]
;;  - Support more visual-block-mode features: insert, append, delete, yank, change.
;;  - Change some vimpulse-functions and some viper-functions to handle
;;    block-mode properly.
;;  - Update documentation to reflect visual-block-mode.
;;  - The '=' command in visual-mode calls 'indent-region'.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Improved XEmacs compatibility.
;;  - Small documentation improvements.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.6.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Removed duplicate definition of vimpulse-detect-mark-deactivate
;;    and duplicate add-hook call to add the hook.  I must have added
;;    the extra copies by accident when doing my last big merge; now
;;    they are gone.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.6.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Merged a patch for the function that powers * and #. Based on
;;    Ryoichi's patch and a cleaned-up version of Weihua's patch --
;;    thanks.  Now * and # will search for entire symbol at point,
;;    including underscores, not just word at point.
;;  - Todo addition.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.5.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Redefined viper-adjust-undo to do nothing.  This way, in
;;    insert mode, typing then moving the cursor then typing more
;;    counts as two separately undoable actions instead of one.
;;    Thanks to Weihua JIANG and to max_ from IRC #emacs for the idea.
;;  - Small extra TODO.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.5.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - I've ignored my local changes for too long.  Here they are:
;;  - added keybindings from a Usenet post by Samuel Padgett
;;  - made change (cw, etc.) commands work more like Vim (my code)
;;  - I removed (setq ex-cycle-other-window nil); although it is very
;;    useful, it merely works around a problem with Viper.  I plan to
;;    discuss it with the Viper maintainer instead.
;;  - other changes and bugfixes from various people
;;  
;; Version 0.2.0.3:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Added Brad's viper-jump-to-tag-at-point
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Small C-w keys and doc fixes.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.1:
;;  [cppjavaperl:]
;;  - Added support for block visual mode (i.e. rectangle selection).
;;  - Made C-p look for matches *prior* to the cursor, added C-n
;;    binding to look for matches *before* the cursor.  This works 
;;    more like Vim does.
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Since vimpulse has no website, I added a prominent 
;;    pointer at the top to the installation instructions.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.0: Brad merged in several changes, including:
;;  - exit visual mode when the mark deactivates
;;  - changed the window manipulation to be global
;;  - added gf (goto file at point)
;;  - added \C-] and \C-t, tag jump & pop
;;  - added a helper function for defining keys
;;  - commented out show-paren-function, what is it meant to do?
;; 
;; Version 0.1.0.1: No code changes.  Small documentation changes,
;; including updates on moving-left bug.
;; 
;; Version 0.1: Initial release.
